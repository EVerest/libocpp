# Grid Profile

This is a foundational Profile designed to act as a sort of temporal grid paper
for testing out different Profile combinations. Each charging schedule period
is exactly 1 hour apart, with the limit increasing by 1 every hour. Since it
has a Stack Level of 0, any Profile with a higher Stack Level will take
precidence over it.
