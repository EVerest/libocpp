# EVerest OCPP Module (`libocpp`)

EVerest's Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) modules are based on this library—`libocpp`—a standalone C++ library implementing client-side OCPP 1.6 and 2.0.1 communications. This library can be used independently of EVerest to enable OCPP communication for a charging station.
 

### What is OCPP?

[OCPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Charge_Point_Protocol) is an open standard for communication between EV charging stations and central management systems. Developed by the [Open Charge Alliance (OCA)](https://openchargealliance.org/), OCPP ensures interoperability among various charging station manufacturers and management systems, playing a vital role in the EV charging ecosystem.
