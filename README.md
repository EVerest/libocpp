# C++ implementation of OCPP

![Github Actions](https://github.com/EVerest/libocpp/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yaml/badge.svg)

This is a C++ library implementation of OCPP for version 1.6, 2.0.1 and 2.1.
(see [OCPP protocols at OCA website](https://openchargealliance.org/protocols/open-charge-point-protocol/)).
The OCPP2.0.1 implementation of libocpp has been certified by the OCA for multiple hardware platforms.

Libocpp's approach to implementing the  OCPP protocol is to address as much functional requirements as possible as part of the library.
Since OCPP is a protocol that affects, controls, and monitors many areas of a charging station's operation this library needs to be
integrated with your charging station firmware.

## Integration with EVerest

This library is integrated within the [OCPP](https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/tree/main/modules/OCPP) and [OCPP201](https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/tree/main/modules/OCPP201)
module within [everest-core](https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core) - the complete software stack for your charging station. It is recommended to use EVerest together with this OCPP implementation.

## Getting Started

Check out the [Getting Started guide](doc/common/getting_started.md). It should be you starting point if you want to integrate this library with your charging station firmware.
