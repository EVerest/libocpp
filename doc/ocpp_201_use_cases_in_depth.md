## OCPP 2.0.1 Use Cases in `libocpp`

The OCPP 2.0.1 specification is broken down into concrete functional requirements using a three-tier system. At the top, there are sixteen **functional blocks** lettered A through P that describe the high-level desired capabilities of actors adhering to the standard. These functional blocks are then broken into **use cases** that describe different scenarios in which one or more charging stations, local controllers, and charging station management systems might find themselves. The required and optional behaviors of these systems in these scenarios are then declared as **functional requirements** within each use case.

This section includes an overview of how a subset of the OCPP 2.0.1 use cases that supported by `libocpp` are implemented in conjunction with callbacks provided by the charging station. We hope it serves as a useful guide to portions of the `libocpp` API and illustrates patterns of interaction between `libocpp` and other systems within a charging station.

> [!NOTE]
> Our goal is not to reproduce the entire OCPP 2.0.1 specification in this document. Rather we intend to illustrate how various use cases are realized using `ChargePoint` methods in `libocpp` in conjunction with callback implementations and event handlers.

> Please refer to the [OCPP 2.0.1 standard](https://openchargealliance.org/protocols/open-charge-point-protocol/#OCPP2.0.1) for more details. Functional blocks, use cases, and functional requirements are addressed in Part 2 of Edition 2.

### Smart Charging Use Cases

The use cases within the Smart Charging functional block are subdivided into the following three categories of use cases:

1. General Smart Charging (Use Cases K01–K10)
2. External Charging Limit-based Smart Charging (K11–K14)
3. ISO 15118-based Smart Charging (K15–K17)

Support for General and External Charging Limit-based Smart Charging is largely complete, with ISO 15118-based Smart Charging under active development. For an up-to-date overview of exactly which features are currently supported as well as design decisions that have been made to address optional or ambiguous functional requirements, please refer to the [OCPP 2.0.1 Status document](ocpp_201_status.md).

#### K01 SetChargingProfile

Allows the CSMS to influence the charging power or current drawn from a specific EVSE or the
entire Charging Station over a period of time.

```mermaid

    CSMS->>+ChargePoint : SetChargingProfileRequest(call)

    ChargePoint->>+DeviceModel : SmartChargingCtrlrAvailable?
    DeviceModel-->>-ChargePoint : Component

    rect rgb(128,202,255) 
    break SmartChargingCtrlrAvailable = false
        ChargePoint-->>CSMS : Smart Charging NotSupported CallError
    end
    end

    ChargePoint->>+SmartCharging : validate_and_add_profile(call.msg.Profile, call.msg.EVSE ID)

    SmartCharging->>SmartCharging : validate_profile(Profile, EVSE ID)

    rect rgb(128,202,255) 
    break Invalid Profile
        SmartCharging-->>ChargePoint : SetChargingProfileResponse: Rejected
        ChargePoint-->>CSMS : SetChargingProfileResponse: Rejected
    end
    end

    SmartCharging->>+SmartCharging : add_profile(Profile, EVSE ID)
    SmartCharging->>-EVerest : signal_set_charging_profiles_callback

    SmartCharging-->>-ChargePoint : SetChargingProfileResponse: Accepted

    ChargePoint-->>-CSMS : SetChargingProfileResponse: Accepted
```

Profile validation returns the following errors to the caller when a Profile
is `Rejected`:

#### K08 Get Composite Schedule

The CSMS requests the Charging Station to report the Composite Charging
Schedule, as calculated by the Charging Station for a specific point of
time, and may change over time due to external causes such as local
balancing based on grid connection capacity and EVSE availablity.

The Composite Schedule is the result of result of merging the time periods
set in the `ChargingStationMaxProfile`, `ChargingStationExternalConstraints`,
`TxDefaultProfile` and `TxProfile` type profiles.
